# Temp Readme:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Each application has been split into their own build directory
- All files are also still in their folders in the main project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When making edits, you'll want to package from the application's build directory
- Make sure that you have the build folder open in vsCode, not the "project-3" folder
- The "project-3" folder is currently set to package an object that only prints a message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Current-as-of-15-Dec jars have been packaged and are stored in folder 2021_12_15_0803_jars
