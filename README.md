# Temp Readme:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Each application has been split into their own build directory
- All files are also still in their folders in the main project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When making edits, you'll want to package from the application's build directory
- using the command "assembly" in sbt instead of "package"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure that you have the build folder open in vsCode, not the "project-3" folder
- The "project-3" folder is currently set to package an object that only prints a message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Current-as-of-14-Dec jars have been packaged and are stored in folder 2021_12_15_0143_jars
